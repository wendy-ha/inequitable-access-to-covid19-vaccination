## Background and motivation
Following the success of COVID-19 vaccine production, the next challenge is to make immunization available to all nations throughout the world, rather than just the richest (WHO Vaccine Equity 2020). In Virtual Global COVID-19 Summit on September 2021, USA President Joe Biden emphasized the importance of solidarity to fight COVID-19 (Remarks by President Biden at Virtual Global COVID-⁠19 Summit 2021). Despite the fact that many countries in the world have often been in conflict over differences in beliefs, religions or politics, we now share a common enemy (Remarks by President Biden at Virtual Global COVID-⁠19 Summit 2021). To defeat COVID-19 in our own nation, we must first unite and defeat them on a worldwide basis (Remarks by President Biden at Virtual Global COVID-⁠19 Summit 2021). 
<br/>
<br/>
Based on this vision, WHO partnered with UNICEF to introduce COVAX, a programme aimed at encouraging equal vaccine distribution in all countries, in which the wealthier nations commit to donating vaccine doses to poor ones (WHO Vaccine Equity 2020).
<br/>
<br/>
COVAX was an idealistic initiative. This project's first goal was to provide 1.4 billion vaccination doses to middle- low and low-income nations by the end of 2021 (WHO Vaccine Equity 2020). However, after COVAX was launched, it was difficult to guarantee that vaccines will be equally distributed over the world. According to data updated to September 2021 in Gavi - The Vaccine Alliance organization, barely 40% of the initial aim has been met (COVAX Global Supply Forecast 2021). On the other hand, the gap in vaccination coverage between rich and poor nations is significant (Nancy 2021). Most residents in rich countries are completely vaccinated; for example, 83.5 percent of Australians aged 16 and over are twice vaccinated, compared to 68.5 percent in the United Kingdom and 75.5 percent in Canada (Nancy 2021). In contrast, less than 1% of people in impoverished nations such as Tanzania, Chad, and Haiti have got their first dose of vaccination (Nancy 2021). 
<br/>
<br/>
**"The global ideal of equitable access to COVID-19 immunizations is unlikely to come true,"** a COVAX official sadly conclude in a statement (Ducharme 2021).
## Questions or problems to answer
This research will undertake a thorough analysis on the issues that impacted the inefficiency in COVAX's acceleration by combining COVID-19 data sets from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data), [Duke Global Health Innovation Centre](https://sdgstoday.org/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-procurement) and [UN Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/undata-country-profiles ) with data visualization methodologies.
<br/>
<br/>
The report specifically seeks to answer the following questions:
- **How does the disparity in vaccination progress occur in terms of nation and region?**
- **What factors have contributed to inequity in worldwide access to Covid vaccines?**
- **How population, economic and quality of healthcare system impact vaccine distribution throughout the world?**

At the end, the purpose of this research is to provide some valuable insights into the parameters controlling COVID-19 vaccine worldwide distribution. Based on this, the COVAX's officials may refer to and optimize their approach for more efficient deployment.
